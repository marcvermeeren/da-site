  <p>
    Decentralized Agency increases our capacity to act by distributing one's agency between those we trust: formalizing feedback loops and social support.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    As a collective, we use this framework to work on tangible as well as speculative projects that are less about being commercially viable and more about shaping viable futures.
